Federico Trotta | [website](https://federicotrotta.com/), [portfolio](https://federico-trotta.github.io/) | Freelance Technical Writer specializing in technical articles, digital products and API documentation. On the side of technical documentation for digital products, I documented digital products ranging from cyber security to AI products as well as integration tools for existing software. I also create documentation for enterprises-internal processes and procedures. My expertise allows me to work with docs by using different commercial solutions, ranging from GitBook to Confluence, as well as contributing to docs-as-code environments, using Markdown and reST.
